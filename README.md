# README

This repository contains the 'final_tidy_data.txt' with the script used to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data Course final project assignment. The original data is from the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset**, version 1.0. The original experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years old. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

For completion of the assignment, I have organized the original data into a tidy dataset and further calculated the averages of each variable per subject per activity.

The dataset includes the following files:
- README.md
- CodeBook.md : describes the dataset, variables and transformation leading to the final dataset
- final_tidy_data.txt : final tidy dataset
- run_analysis.R : R script containing the code leading to the final data set (avg_data)
